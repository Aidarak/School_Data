# School_Data
Worked individually to create a program that takes in a Calgary school name or school code, then outputs mean enrollment for each grade. This program uses different CSV files for different years and enrollment data from different schools within the city.

This app was made by creating and manipulating arrays using the numpy module. By accepting and validating user input and processing data using dictionaries, I was able to manipulate and execute numpy array computations to plot data using the matplotlib module. This project also allowed me to pratice creating an object instance using a given class and using instance methods for a given class.
